1. Change the title potentially?
2. Spelling and diacritics (consistency)
3. Change gamaka to pitch modulation (instead of vibrato)(Reference as much as possible)
The performance of swara is not fixed, be careful of saying things are fixed (hard rules)
4. Check referencing style in some places.
4. Plots are good, be descriptive as possible.
5. Add a diagram for methodology
6. Talk about gaps that previous research has kept open
Dataset was limited, analysis didn't look at violin. 
7. Carnatic intonation section needs expansion, reduce pythagorean tuning.
8. Minimize section of CREPE.
9. Potentially use the same algorithm
10. Check thresholding to see if it excludes the same type of notes (check pitch distribution)
11. Keep the musicological trends.
12. Read the resources thoroughly
13. 
a) Do they apply
b) Is there a difference between violin and vocals
c) Is there a difference when observing between various sections? Why would there be differences?
14. Statistical tests for violin vs vocal
15. T tests, man whitney u tests, cross entropy.
16. Check pitch smoothing algorithm
17. Better plots for intonation
18. Find an algorithm to find aarohanas and avarohana sections
19.
